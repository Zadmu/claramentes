You guys are also welcome to add to-do list items if I forget, like homework, assessments, and more. You can post videos in the discussion tab, and also include links in the to-do list cards. Iâ€™m John, a junior at Wildcats high school. My email is jsmith@gmail.com if you want to contact me. I have taken college prep chemistry and am now taking AP chem. I made this group for people like me who like to learn with other people, which is why this website is so helpful. If you would like to set up a study session feel free to, and I will definitely join. Have fun learning chem!",
